<!-- title: AGM -->

# Sample companies

## General observations
  
- Data consists of spread prices mostly.  
- Significant processing overhead.
  - Photos sometimes too blurry to read.
  - Some companies miss records for extended periods. Therefore when not finding records for a company, need to process sample period day by day from the beginning to check if some records exist for certain sub-periods within the sample period. Very expensive in time.
- Processing time: for companies with consistent records, 3 to 4 months/hour.

## Specifics

- Edward Lloyd (paper/pulp).
  Found no records in 1913.
- London General Omnibus.
  - Records for common stock only up to early September 1912.
  - More records for preferred stock and bonds.
