6 firms shows 3 end of year dates for 1912. All railways: 'RL016', 'RL030', 'RL031', 
'RL035', 'RL042', 'RL071'. All show the same dates: '1912-01-31', '1912-07-31', 
'1912-12-31'. All these report semi-annually up until 1912 with 1913 reported 
annually. <br>
A temporary fix has been applied to these: the last date of reporting period end 
for 1912 has been changed from '1912-12-31' to '1913-01-01' so that there remain 
only two reporting period for the 1912 year, labelled as reporting semi-annually. 
Similarly the date of reporting period end for 1913 has been changed from 
'1913-12-31' to '1914-01-01' so that there remains only one reporting period for 
the year 1913, labelled as reporting annually.
