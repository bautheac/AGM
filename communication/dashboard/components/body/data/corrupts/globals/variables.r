This page shows the corrupts records found in the raw data extracted from the 
main source files. Most corrupts records have been cleaned as resulting from an 
obvious typo. The detail of these corrections is shown in the 'sorted' section 
below. A number of other incorrect entries for which the error is not obvious are 
still to be addessed. The detail of these is shown in the 'pending' section below.
